# Lab 10 - Service Discovery

This lab will include exercises for exploring service discovery in Prometheus.

Prometheus configurations are documented here: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/.

## Grading

Submit answers to the following questions:
- How is service discovery important to monitoring and security?
- How does file based service discovery differ from HTTP service discovery?
- What is relabelling and how is it relevant to service discovery?
- How is a meta label different from a normal label?

## File-Based Service Discovery

Read about file-based service discovery in the Prometheus docs here: https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/file-sd/#use-file-based-service-discovery-to-discover-scrape-targets.

## HTTP Service Discovery

Read about HTTP service discovery in the Prometheus docs here: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/http_sd/.

## Relabelling

Read about Prometheus relabelling here: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config.

## Cloud Service Discovery

Navigate to the Prometheus configuration file configuration documentation (https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/) and choose a service discovery configuration such as azure_sd_config. Read through the documentation for that configuration.
